This script provides a consistent way to list to the complete oeuvre of J.S. Bach, as it spans more than a thousand pieces, which are considered an essential part of the western repertoire.
A list of your past listens is saved in 

### Installation (with Gnome as a DE)

To install the script, run `./install.sh gnome` and you're done!

This method only works with GNOME.

### Use as a terminal command

If GNOME isn't your current Desktop Manager, or if you don't want to listen to Bach at every startup (shame on you), you can still run the script via command line.

To do it, run: `./install.sh`

Now you can get your daily dose of counterpoint with: `Bach`

By default, it returns 03 links, but you can pass a value as an argument to get more results (e.g. `Bach 5`).
