### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ofefo/welcomeBach.git`


2. Edit **gnome-terminal.desktop**, replacing the path to welcomeBach.sh:

*In line 3:*
`Exec=path/to/welcomeBach/welcomeBach.sh`

3. Then run:

`bash setup.sh`

And it's done!

Make sure you have the */autostart* folder! If you don't, create it before step 3 with:
