Today's Bach is: 
  BWV 1079 â€“ Musikalisches Opfer (The Musical Offering)

```


### Installation (with Gnome as a DE)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ofefo/welcomeBach.git`

2. Then run `./install.sh gnome` and it's done!

This method only works with GNOME.

### Use as a terminal command

If GNOME isn't your currently Desktop Manager, or if you don't want to listen to Bach everytime you login (shame on you), you can still run the script via command line.

To do it, run: `./install.sh`

Now you can get your daily dose of counterpoint with: `Bach`
