### Installation (with Gnome as a DE)

To install the script, simply run run `./install.sh gnome` and you're done!

This method only works with GNOME.

### Use as a terminal command

If GNOME isn't your currently Desktop Manager, or if you don't want to listen to Bach at every startup (shame on you), you can still run the script via command line.

To do it, run: `./install.sh`

Now you can get your daily dose of counterpoint with: `Bach`
